			The above quote from the U.S. Copyright Office's website is broad, but clear regarding music that's composed and consumed in traditional ways. Generally speaking, if you own the rights to a piece of music, you have the right to do whatever you want with it. However, what happens when a piece is created
			coincidentally?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="mb-5">
		<h4>Why (copy)write a piece like this?</h4>
		<p>
			Chance is a crucial element in all of my music. Whether it's by how a performer interprets my engraved notation, or by programming the electronics in my piece to playback sound indeterminately, not only does incorporating chance make every iteration, playback, or performance of a piece unique, but it also
			creates coincidental sound combinations/sequences that, likely, wouldn't be possible for the composer to intend.

		</figure>
		<p>
			One series of sounds that a composer might not've intended when using chance in their writing is a recreation a copyrighted melody. If it wasn't the composer's intention, does it fall into fair use? If a court rules that if the composition can generate copyrighted content, does that mean future compositions
			need to take this into account?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="mb-5">
		<h4>Before we talk about methods + code, what's kinda algorithms are we talking about? üß†</h4>
		<p>
			The most important thing I want to be taken into consideration is that this piece is caricature of a more nuanced issue. The methods, including the code and source material, are all based on well-known, relatively easy-to-recognize (at least to a Western audience), and most importantly <span class="fw-bold"
				>copyrighted</span> melodies.
		</p>
		<p>Here's some Javascript code that will generate a random melody with the following constraints:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>7 - 12 notes in length</li>
			<li>Each note can be a half, quarter, eighth, or sixteenth note, or rest</li>
			<li>Pitches will be from an equally tempered chromatic scale from C4 to C5</li>
		</ul>
		<figure>
			<img class="img-fluid" src="{base}/code-1.png" alt="Javascript code that generates a random melody" />
			<figcaption style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(108, 117, 125);">Javascript code that generates a random melody</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			This is a very simple example with several limitations; however, there are many melodies (or melodic fragments) that this program could produce notation to playback. Speaking from my experience, algorithms that are used for generating any kind of melodic content have more variety influencing any output;
			however, the above example can serve as a skeleton for generating content.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="mb-5">
		<h4 class="mb-4">Alright, now we can talk about methods + code</h4>
		<h5>Breaking down the sound world üåé</h5>
		<p>
			During my junior year of my Bachelor's, my advisor told me something along the lines of, "If all your piece is doing is playing back numbers, it's not music... it's a science experiment." While I don't agree with it entirely/literally, there is truth behind the "artist's touch" impacting the music in such a
			way that makes it theirs. If two composers sit down and program the same algorithm to output the same content, there's little to no sense of originality in the output. However, I wanted this piece to serve as an accessory to the (somewhat) scientific research I'm conducting for this class. So, the
			compositional choices I made aimed to reconcile my aesthetic and research goals
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="mb-3">
		<h5>Texture and incidental sounds</h5>
		<p>
			I almost always use electronic sounds as an accompaniment or textural element of a piece. Sometimes they're based on a direct response to the inspiration/concept behind a piece. Other times, it is purely vibe/intuition based. That being said, in addition to the melodies that play throughout the piece, I
			added two textural layers to the sound world:
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="mb-3">
		<h5>Ambient Loop</h5>

		<p>
			The below code snippet mostly consists of instructions that tell the program to "loop" the ambiences by cross-fading two sound files at certain points. This is because of challenges I've faced trying to create seamless loops of complex sounds in the browser. Dovetailing and cross-fading has been the most
			effective approach for me. Other than the "looping" logic, all the function does is:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tell the sound files to fade in and out over 5 seconds</li>
			<li>Sets their initial volumes to -12dB</li>
			<li>and, Chooses a random note to play.</li>
		</ul>
		<img class="img-fluid" src="{base}/code-2.png" alt="A code block showing the looping logic" />
	</div>
	<div class="mb-3">
		<h5 class="mt-3">Incidental sounds</h5>
		<p>Every once and a while, the piece will play a curated, but arbitrary sound. There is a bank of 20 sounds the piece will choose from at any given time. These were all found on my hard drive as part of sound libraries I've collected over the years.</p>
		<div class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center align-items-center gap-2 mb-3">

					Your browser does not support the audio element.
				</audio>
			{/each}
		</div>
		<p>
			Because the incidental sounds aren't being looped, the code regarding their playback is pretty straightforward. Every 0.5 to 1.5 seconds, there's an 8% chance that the piece will play one of the 20 sounds. the <code>if (!finished)</code> at the top of the function just checks to see if the piece is currently
			playing in order to prevent the incidental sounds from playing after the piece has finished.

			<li>Playing back the melody using a bank of curated samples.</li>

	<div class="mb-3">
		<h5>Melodic source materials</h5>
		<p>When composing this piece, I took creative liberties regarding any melodic transformations; however, the source material is all pre-notated using my transcriptions of 14 "well-known" melodies, which are:</p>

			<li class="fst-italic">Billie Jean</li>

			<li class="fst-italic">Careless Whisper</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="mb-3">
		<h5>Notating a melody</h5>
		<p>All of the melodic playback is being handled by a Javascript library called Tone.js . When coding instructions for audio playback, a pitch and rhythm must be provided. In my case, I chose to notate pitch using pitch-register notation, and I chose to notate rhythm using BPM/time signature relative values.</p>
		<p>The code snippet below shows an example melody's "meta-data", including the melodic notation.</p>
		<img class="img-fluid" src="{base}/code-4.png" alt="A code block showing the meta-data for a melody" />
	</div>
	<div class="mb-3">
		<h5>Melodic alteration</h5>
		<p>
			Because I wanted the piece to (somewhat) simulate a musical environment where there's a likelihood of hearing something recognizable, and potentially copyrighted, in most cases, each melody is transformed in some way before it reaches the playback stage. And, because of the extreme unlikelihood of a
			copyrighted melody to be played back through several layers of chance, I gave the program a 1% chance to let a melody pass through the code unaltered. When a melody is transformed, it undergoes 1 of 3 possible alterations, and an almost guaranteed tempo alteration.:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pitch alteration. The pitch changes, but the register stays the same.</li>
			<li>Rhythm alteration. The note value changes to a half, quarter, eighth, sixteenth, or dotted duration.</li>
			<li>Truncation. The melody stops after a certain point</li>
			<li>Tempo alteration. There is a 99% chance that a melody will be played back at a tempo 20BPM faster or slower.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In order to stay consistent with the original idea of the piece, which revolves around thinking that you might've encountered this melody before, the transformations follow a couple parameters:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The transformation is more likely to occur the later into the melody you get. This usually ensures that the melody starts off recognizable, but ends up unrecognizable</li>
			<li>Transformations apply to all notes after the first transformation. In other words, the only time a melody will change one note is if that note is the last note.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The below code block is for altering pitches. It runs until it selects a random pitch from the pitches array, then returns the pitch. Then, for every note in the melody, based on the likelihood which is influenced by how early/late the note is in the melody, change the pitch. If the pitch before the current
			pitch is flagged as "changed", the current pitch is changed by default (no chance necessary). The only section that might be unintuitive is the part that defines <code>pitch</code>, which uses, <code>split()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, and <code>join()</code>. All this does is remove the register from
			the note, because all the function is concerned with is the pitch.
		</p>
		<img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="{base}/code-5.png" alt="A code block showing the pitch alteration logic" />
		<p>The next code block alters durations. If you compare it to the pitch alteration function, you'll notice that they're mostly similar. The only main difference is that instead of selecting a pitch from an array of pitches, this function selects a rhythm from an array of rhythms.</p>
		<img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="{base}/code-6.png" alt="A code block showing the rhythm alteration logic" />
		<p>
			The next transformation truncates the melody after a certain point. This is the simplest of the transformation to visualize. It follows the same logic that the previous transformations use in terms of flagging a note as the first note to undergo a transformation, then applying a transformation to the rest
			of the notes in the melody; however, in this case, because the melody is being truncated, it just cuts it off after the first flagged note.
		</p>
		<img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="{base}/code-7.png" alt="A code block showing the truncation logic" />
		<p>
			The last alteration involves changing the melody's tempo. The reason why I chose to make this alteration mandatory, is due to slight tempo changes not having as profound of an impact on one's ability to recognize a melody. This function is very simple. It just adds or subtracts a number up to 25% of the
			original tempo of the melody.
		</p>
		<img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="{base}/code-8.png" alt="A code block showing the tempo alteration logic" />
	</div>
	<div class="mb-3">
		<h5>Melodic playback</h5>
		<p>
			The <code>playMelody()</code> function is responsible for taking the rhythm data from each note in the melody and converting it to a value in milliseconds (remember that each melody is originally notated using tempo-relative values). Because this part of the code is scheduling all of the melody to occur in advance,
			those schedules can also tied to other aspects of the piece that rely on time, like making a simple visualization, and generating an analysis file.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="mb-5">
		<h5>Samples</h5>
		<p>I decided to make use of 3 different samples for melodic playback.</p>
		<div class="d-flex gap-5 mb-3">
			<div class="d-flex flex-column justify-content-between w-100">

		</div>
		<p>The code below shows how a melody is converted for playback purposes, which involves translating the rhythms to millisecond values, and selecting a sample at random for playback.</p>
		<img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="{base}/code-9.png" alt="A code block showing the playback logic" />
		<p>
			Then, we schedule the playback event to occur at a point after the previous note finishes. The code that controls sound playback is <code>sampler.triggerAttackRelease()</code>, which is Tone.js' method for taking a sound source and playing it back for a defined length of time. In addition to general
			playback, the timing part of the code is also responsible for:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Generating analysis data, but this only happens on the first note. Otherwise the same data for the whole melody would be generated with each note.</li>
			<li>Lighting up a random "note sliver", which is a horizontal slice of the screen that functions as a pitch visualizer during the piece's playback.</li>
			<li>Generating another melody after a delay, but this only happens on the last note. Otherwise a melody would trigger each time a note plays back.</li>
		</ul>
		<img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="{base}/code-10.png" alt="A code block showing the playback scheduling logic" />
	</div>
	<div class="mb-5">
		<h4>What does the data tell us? ü§î</h4>
		<p>This section is about what data I recorded. All of the data can be visualized in different ways in the later sections of the webpage.</p>
		<p>Because my original idea for transcription, sound-coding, and visualization revolved around seeing how each of the melodies differed from their original source material, I structured each analysis file to include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A timestamp that shows when the melody started playback.</li>
			<li>The name of the original melody.</li>
			<li>The notation for the original melody.</li>
			<li>The original tempo.</li>
			<li>The altered tempo.</li>
			<li>The notation for the altered melody.</li>
			<li>3 containers for each of the 3 "optional" melodic transformations. Each container reports: the note where the change occurs, and the fragment of the melody that consists of all of the alterations.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Here's an example of a fragment from <span style="color: HotPink;">Nicol's phone</span></p>
		<img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="{base}/code-11.png" alt="A code block showing an example of a fragment from Nicol's phone" />
		<p>I think the best way to get anything meaningful from the data is to play around with it yourself. Use the sections later in the webpage to look at single sound sources, compare multiple, or look at the performance visualization.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="mb-3">
		<h4>Did we learn anything about copyright? ¬©Ô∏è</h4>
		<p>Because music copyright uses broad language to cover situations involving music that's created/consumed using traditional idioms, I think it's best to look at the Fair Use Statute.</p>
		<figure class="ms-3">
			<blockquote class="blockquote fs-6">
				Section 107 of the Copyright Act gives examples of purposes that are favored by fair use: ‚Äúcriticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, [and] research.‚Äù Use for one of these purposes is not automatically fair, and uses for other purposes can be
				fair. The statute lays out four factors to consider in deciding whether a particular use is fair.
			</blockquote>
			<figcaption class="blockquote-footer"><cite title="Penn State Copyright Information">Penn State Copyright Information</cite></figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>This leads us to the "Four Factors of Fair Use"</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.</li>
			<li>The nature of the copyrighted work.</li>
			<li>The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.</li>
			<li>The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Using the Fair Use Statute as a legal metric for whether or not a piece like this would leave any of the artists/entities that own the rights to the melodies I used as source material for this piece, I think it's fair to say that I'm not going to be expecting any cease and desist letters anytime soon ü§£.</p>
		<p>
			However, like I mentioned at the beginning of this write up, this is a caricature piece that is designed to make an incredibly unlikely scenario much more likely in a somewhat controlled environment as a proof of concept. The question about how algorithmic composition pertains to copyright infringement is
			still up in the air.
		</p>
		<p>Putting my piece aside, and looking at algorithmic composition more broadly as a whole, what do the "Four Factors of Fair Use" have to say?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="mb-3">
		<h5>Purpose and character of the use</h5>
		<p>
			This is going to be completely unique based on the piece in question. If someone uses an algorithm to generate melodic content randomly, and it just so happens a recording gets a snippet of <span class="fst-italic">My Heart Will Go On</span>, YouTube might flag the video for removal, but it will most likely
			win any appeal due to the incidental nature of the content. However, if the algorithm uses large, recognizable samples from the piece without any effort to transform the source material, I think there's room to argue that the copyrighted piece in question might be entitled to some/all of the intellectual
			property. It really depends on the situation.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="mb-3">
		<h5>The nature of the copyrighted work</h5>
		<p>
			At first glance, this factor felt a little bit irrelevant. After all, if the copyrighted work is the intellectual property in question, what difference does it make that it makes an appearance in another work. All the really matters is the sound, right? Well, no... I think it's very crucial to distinguish
			the natures between the original work and the work that's referencing it. In the case of my work that uses algorithms to generate music output, the point isn't to create a parody, cover, or linear narrative. It's to repurpose the sound for my aesthetic goals, and if my goals are starkly different in
			comparison to the intentions of the original work, I agree those are grounds for fair use.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="mb-3">
		<h5>Amount and substantiality</h5>
		<p>
			Is the hook, or the intro of a popular melody enough to constitute a violation of the original work's intellectual property? This is definitely unique based on the work in question. Some popular songs consist of mostly repeated material, like in the case of <a
				href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKYPYj2XX80">Daft Punk's <span class="fst-italic">Around the World</span></a> (which also makes use of samples, by the way). What would be an amount that would raise a red flag? Does any amount of the original work give the copyright holder the right to take legal action,
			then the court decides if it's fair use?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="mb-5">
		<h5>Effect on potential market value</h5>
		<p>Is the traction gained by an algorithmically generated composition that likely has no connection to the original work going to have any impact on the original work's market value? I think it's safe to say that the answer is no in pretty much all cases, but you never know.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="mb-5">
		<h4>Figuring out specific timings in the recording. ‚åõ</h4>
		<p>
			My iPhone's <span class="fst-italic">Voice Memos</span> only tells me recording start and end times to the nearest minute. That being said, the recording is exactly <span class="fw-bold">18 minutes and 20 seconds long</span>, so I figure the performance had to have started in the
			<span class="fw-bold">range of 10:10:40AM to 10:10:59AM</span>. For the sake of consistency, I'll assume that the recording started at 10:10:40AM.
		</p>
		<p>Upon examining the audio file closely in Ableton Live, the performance starts approximately when I say, "Go", which can be seen in the images below taking place approximately 5 minutes and 3 seconds into the recording. This suggests that the performance starts at 10:15:43AM.</p>

		<p>This presents an issue because when looking at the analysis files for some of the participants, melodies were first generated as early as 10:14.</p>
		<ul>
			{#each earlyMelodies as { name, time }}
				<li>{name} - {time}</li>
			{/each}
		</ul>
		<p>I'm assuming that there we're participants who started the piece in advance and faded their volume in when I said go. That being said, all melodies generated before 10:15:43AM won't be included in the timeline visualizations for individual participants.</p>
		<p>Looking at the audio recording, the performance ending after we all applauded, which occurs approximately 10 minutes and 18 seconds into the recording, making the length of the performance roughly 5 minutes and 15 seconds, suggesting that the performance ended at 10:20:57AM.</p>
