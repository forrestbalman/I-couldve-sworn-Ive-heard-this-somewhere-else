I could've sworn I heard this before... is a proof of concept piece that explores ideas of music copyright and how it pertains to algorithmically generated music. If algorithmic compositions are held to the same legal standards as manually composed music, how would composers go about accounting for the possibility of their algorithm outputting legally protected material?

The piece generates content based on popular melodies that aren't in the public domain. There is a small likelihood that any of the melodies could be played through in their entirety, but the chance that each successive note in the melody triggers after the first becomes less and less likely. However, because the material that's can be outputted is based on pre-composed melodies, this piece serves more as a controlled demonstration of what could happen in an algorithmic composition with complete randomness.
